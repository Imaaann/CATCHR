# CATCHR

## Rhythm game where you catch the beats

CATCHR is a web based rhythm game made with NextJS and using the Canvas API where you play as a little white blob tasked to catch
all the beats from normal hit-circles, sliders, and avoiding mines. CATCHR also spices things up with mode changes in the middle of a level with the **reverse** and the **double** modes. CATCHR also offers a variety of levels and difficulties for all skill levels
